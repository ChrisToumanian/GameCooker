		<h1>GameCooker API Documentation</h1>

		<h3><b>GameCooker is a lightweight JavaScript game engine. </b>
		GameCooker is an attempt to expose the good parts of JavaScript for game creation in a simple way.
		The game engine has multiple preset utilities you can refer to with this simple API. You design games by creating templates for levels and game objects.</h3>
		
		<h2>Getting Started</h2>

		<h3>If you do not have access to an FTP server and would like to try out the game engine, you can download a zip it <a href="http://devdocs.io/javascript/">here</a>. 
		Extract it to a folder and drag index.html into a web browser to launch your game. Any of the text files can be modified in a standard text editor and changes will be 
		updated when you refresh the page. For editing code without an IDE <a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/">Notepad++</a> 
		and <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/?utm_expid=101350005-21.ckupCbvGQMiML5eJsxWmxw.0&utm_referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F">Visual Studio Code</a> 
		are lightweight and extremely helpful, completing syntax for you, providing dropdown lists of what APIs can be accessed, and correctly indenting.

		</br></br>

		Begin by creating new gameObject prototype JavaScript files. Instantiate the objects you would like in level01.js. Add as many levels as you'd like and load them at any time.

		</br></br>

		You can get started immediately by opening level01.js. This is loaded when the game first begins and it defines where every GameObject will be located on the screen 
		through the function <code>spawn();</code>. Just tell it which objects you'd like to be in the level and where.
		Each GameObject requires its own script, such as coin.js, or angrysun.js, to work.
		They begin with a constructor such as <code>GameObject.prototype.Coin = function(){}</code> to work.
		All GameObjects inherit the properties and functions of their parent class, located in gameobject.js, so you can use them freely and modify them to anything you'd like.
		GameObjects default to an invisible, red colored square unless told otherwise. They can be given images and sounds to play if you declare them on the bottom of the script.
		See the scripts in the Mario themed example game for correct usage.

		</br></br>

		<h2>Game Engine</h2>
			<h3>The JavaScript file <code>gameengine.js</code> is where <code>Main()</code> is located and where the game begins.
			It also takes care of the game loop, display properties and drawing to the HTML5 canvas. You don't have to modify this script,
			but you can modify any of its settings from any gameObject.</h3>
			<table><tbody>
				<tr><td><code>Game.network.enabled</code></td><td>Set to true or false to enable network settings such as IP-location saving and leaderboards.</td></tr>
				<tr><td><code>Game.difficulty</code></td><td>Set the game difficulty to a setting like "easy," "normal," or "hard."</td></tr>
				<tr><td><code>Game.diagnostics</code></td><td>Enable or disable the diagnostics HUD that contains FPS and object calls.</td></tr>
				<tr><td><code>Game.time</code></td><td>Set how quickly the game runs, 1 for a normal speed and 0 for paused.</td></tr>
			</tbody></table>
			<table><tbody>
				<tr><td><code>Display.width</code></td><td>Set the width of the display/game canvas.</td></tr>
				<tr><td><code>Display.height</code></td><td>Set the height of the display/game canvas.</td></tr>
				<tr><td><code>Display.FPS</code></td><td>Updates to show the current frames per second.</td></tr>
				<tr><td><code>Display.maxFPS</code></td><td>Sets the maximum frames per second the game tries to run at.</td></tr>
				<tr><td><code>Display.bgColor</code></td><td>Set the background color rendered first behind all gameObjects.</td></tr>
			</tbody></table>

		<h2>Player</h2>
			<h3><b>The Player class is an object that holds information about the current player.</b> It is instantiated from the GameEngine when the page is first loaded
			and immediately checks for the player's IP address and looks up a matching username.</h3>
			<table><tbody>
				<tr><td><code>Player.username</code></td><td>Sets the <code>Player</code> username.</td></tr>
				<tr><td><code>Player.ID</code></td><td>Sets the ID of the <code>Player</code>, if there are multiple players.</td></tr>
				<tr><td><code>Player.IP</code></td><td>Sets the <code>Player</code> IP address.</td></tr>
				<tr><td><code>Player.score</code></td><td>The player's score for the current level.</td></tr>
				<tr><td><code>Player.highScore</code></td><td>The player's highest recorded score.</td></tr>
				<tr><td><code>Player.leader[#]</code></td><td>Stores the highest leaderboard scores.</td></tr>
				<tr><td><code>Player.getIP()</code></td><td>Function that sets the player's IP address.</td></tr>
				<tr><td><code>Player.getHighScore()</code></td><td>Retrieves the player's highest recorded score.</td></tr>
				<tr><td><code>Player.getLeaderboard()</code></td><td>Gets the top leaderboard users and sets <code>Player.leader[#]</code></td></tr>
			</tbody></table>

		<h2>Level</h2>
			<h3>The Level stores information for what GameObjects and music are loaded when a level begins and where. The first level to load is level01.js.
				More can be created and spawned.
			</h3>

		<h2>GameObject</h2>
			<h3>Everything on the screen in a game is a GameObject and requires an individual script to define information about how it looks and behaves. 
				GameObjects inherit their properties and functions from gameobject.js. The <code>update()</code> routine of every GameObject is called once per frame.
			</h3>

		<h2>Input</h2>
			<h3>This is a utility for checking to see if specific keys, gamepad buttons are pressed or the mouse is moving.</h3>
